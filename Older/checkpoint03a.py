# Purpose: Create a python class for student
#############################################

# Create a class for a Student, that contains a first name, a last name, and an id.

# Create an __init__ function in your class that initializes the first name, last name, and id to "", "", and 0, respectively.

# Create a regular function (not a member function just yet) called prompt_student that creates a new student object, then prompts the user for a first name, last name, and id. The function should assign these to the appropriate properties of the object and return it.

# Create a regular function (not a member function) called display_student that accepts a student object, and displays its information in the following format: "id - FirstName LastName".

# Then, create a main function that does the following:

# Calls the prompt_student function and saves the returned value in a variable called "user".

# Pass the user object to the display_student function to be displayed.

# Sample Output
# The following is an example of output for this program:

# Please enter your last name: Smith
# Please enter your id number: 12512

# Your information:
