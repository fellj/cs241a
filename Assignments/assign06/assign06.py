# For this milestone, you need to first get the provided code to run,
# then implement bullets firing correctly as well as a single "normal"
# target flying across the screen.
# 
# You should recognize that a bullet and a target have many things
# in common, and create a base class with these common elements that
# they can both derive from.
# 
# Thus, at a minimum, you should have the following:
# 
# A base class for flying objects.
# 
# A class for a bullet.
# 
# A class for a target.
# 
# Demonstrate the rifle taking aim and firing bullets in the correct direction.
# 
# Demonstrate bullets flying across the screen.
# 
# Demonstrate a target flying across the screen.
# 
# The following are not specifically required at this point
# (although having them done already would be a great thing!):
# 
# All three types of targets
# 
# Bullets and targets dying when they collide
# 
# Bullets and targets dying when they leave the screen
# 
# Scoring
# 
# 
# Don't forget to make use of the Point and Velocity classes from the Pong project.
# 
# It is much easier to start bullets at the corner of the screen
# (inside the rifle) than at the tip of the barrel, and this will
#  be sufficient as long as the angle is correct.
